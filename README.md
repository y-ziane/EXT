# `Cloudstream3 Plugin Repo Template`

Template for a [Cloudstream3](https://github.com/recloudstream) plugin repo

**⚠️ Make sure you check "Include all branches" when using this template**

 
## Getting started with writing your first plugin

This template includes 1 example plugin.

1. Open the root build.gradle.kts, read the comments and replace all the placeholders
2. Familiarize yourself with the project structure. Most files are commented
3. Build or deploy your first plugin using:
   - Windows: `.\gradlew.bat ExampleProvider:make` or `.\gradlew.bat ExampleProvider:deployWithAdb`
   - Linux & Mac: `./gradlew ExampleProvider:make` or `./gradlew ExampleProvider:deployWithAdb`


## Granting All Files Access on Newer Android Devices

For local plugin testing, you need to grant the app "All Files Access" on newer Android devices (Android 11 and above). Here’s how to do it:

### Using ADB

* `adb shell appops set --uid PACKAGE_NAME MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE allow`
* Replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the name of the package for the Cloudstream3 version you are using:
   - debug: `com.lagradost.cloudstream3.prerelease.debug`
   - prerelease: `com.lagradost.cloudstream3.prerelease`
   - stable: `com.lagradost.cloudstream3`

### Manually

1. **Open Settings**: Go to your device’s Settings menu.

2. **Navigate to Special Access**:
   - Tap on "Apps & notifications" or "Apps".
   - Select "Special app access" or "Special access".

3. **Select All Files Access**:
   - Tap on "All files access".
   - It may be under the three vertical dots menu towards the top of the screen.

4. **Grant Access to the App**: Find the app in the list and tap on it to toggle it, if it is not already enabled.

6. **Restart the App**: Close and reopen the app to apply the changes.
